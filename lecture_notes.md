## Intro Slide
No notes

## Slide One
**Objective:** Introduce the formal definition of JavaScript.

Suggested Script
---
So, what exactly is JavaScript?
A simple Google search gives us this definition.

<click>
>an object-oriented computer programming language
>commonly used to create interactive effects within
>web browsers

Let's break this definition up a bit...

<click> So, JavaScript is a computer programming language...

<click> is commonly used to create interactive effects

<click> within web browsers

Ok, sounds pretty straight forward, but how does JavaScript fit into our website?

## Slide Two
**Objective:** Compare the process of creating an interactive website to that of creating an interactive robot.

Suggested Script
---
To help us visual this concept, let's compare creating an interactive website, to that of creating a robot.

<click> So, just like a website, we first need to build up the structure of a robot. So, it's head and body.

<click> This is kind of like using HTML to build up the structure of a website.

<click> Next, you typically want your robot to look cool, so you give it a paint job.

<click> Kind of like using CSS to make your website look presentable.

But as you can see it's not interactive (try dragging robot image).

<click>

## Slide Three
**Objective:** Continue interactive website vs interactive robot comparison.

Suggested Script
---
To make a robot be able to interact with you, you need to program it with a set of instructions.

Similar to a robot, if we want our website to be interactive, we need to give it instructions.

So, if I want my website to respond a certain way to a mouse click (right-click for pop-up message) or want to make an image on my site draggable (drag robot), I need to program it with instructions.

You can do this with JavaScript!

## Slide Four
**Objective:** Inform students of familiar web applications that use JavaScript.

Suggested Script
---
Everyday, you probably visit a site that uses JavaScript and don't realize it.

<click> Web applications such as
<click> Facebook,
<click> Gmail and
<click> Google Maps use JavaScript to execute many key features.

## Slide Five
**Objective:** Expand on familiar web application example by explaining how the Facebook share dialog box uses JavaScript.

Suggested Script
---
So for example, whenever you
<click> share an
<click> article on Facebook, JavaScript is being executed.

## Slide Six
**Objective:** Provide another familiar example in the form of a lightbox photo gallery.

Suggested Script
---
Or if you've ever visited a website that had an
<click> interactive photo gallery, then chances are it is using JavaScript.

## Slide Seven
**Objective:** Get students to think about how they can make their websites interactive.

Web Whiteboard: [Web Whiteboard](https://awwapp.com/b/u3vvpzrrn/)

Suggested Script
---
Using the class whiteboard, think of some ways you can make your website more interactive.

## Slide Eight
**Objective:** This slide is used to introduce a class activity, which would be creating a simple alert message using a browser console.

Ideally, the instructor would demonstrate this activity live and not use a slide or screenshot.

Suggested Script
---
The good thing about JavaScript is that we can write a program using the console in our browser.

So, let's jump right into writing our first program.

(Students should follow along as the instructor opens a JavaScript console in Google Chrome)

<click> First, open Google Chrome, if you don't have it open already.

Next, click on View, go down to Developer, then click on JavaScript Console.

## Slide Nine
**Objective:** This slide is used to introduce a class activity, which would be creating a simple alert message using a browser console.

Ideally, the instructor would demonstrate this activity live and not use a slide or screenshot.

Suggested Script
---
The console is where we can tell the browser what to do using JavaScript.

I want the browser to display a pop-up message with my favorite quote, so I am going to write this JavaScript command in the console.

alert("Winter is Coming!");

Voila, the browser displayed a pop-up with my favorite quote. Pretty cool, huh?

Now you give it a try.

## Slide Ten
**Objective:** Answer questions students may have about what was covered so far.
